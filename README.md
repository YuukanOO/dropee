dropee - A tiny SCSS Toolkit you can just drop in your project
===

**dropee** is a simple and easy to use toolkit trying to optimize your workflow for the most common problems without outputting anything. Your markup, your rules!

I'm not a Sass Guru but wanted a tiny toolkit used from prototype to production, without predefined classes, and that's how **dropee** was born!

## Installation

Just copy and paste the content of the file you want or use `npm install dropee`.

## Documentation & examples

Have a look at the [online documentation](https://yuukanoo.github.io/dropee/)!
